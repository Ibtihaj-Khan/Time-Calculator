This is the Time Calculator project, as part of the Free Code Camp "Scientific Computing With Python" curriculum.

It is basically a function that takes in 3 params:
    - Start Time
    - Time Elapsed
    - Day of Week (optional)

The return is the start time plus the time elapsed, formatted back into 12 hr AM/PM format, and the amount of days that have passed, if any.

If the Day of Week param is used, the output will also tell you what day it is at the end.
